Findings

Finding 1:  Sony took over Lead studio & Profitability ranking gradually from Fox and Universal Studio by producing extra ordinary Comedy & Romance movies. 

Finding 2:  Romance movies took over the popularity of Comedy films in 2011 as per the trend shows. Movies like Water for elephants and Waiting for forever  were the top 2 romance movies which accelerated this change. 

Finding 3: Sony, Fox & Disney were the top three market leaders, where Sony was leading with less than 1% profitability over Fox & Disney

Finding 4: Overall profitability depends on the quality of the film produced and not on Genre it’s produced in. Tangled total gross was 355.4 Million and Its Animation Movie. 

Finding 5: There is a huge mismatch between RottenTomatoes Scoring & Worldwide scoring.

Finding 6: Wating for forever didnt do well in terms of profitability because of independant production, as I belive there is a impact of repputation of the produciton studio as well on Audience psychology.
